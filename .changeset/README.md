# Changesets

This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`. It stores
the pending release notes and semantic version bump information for every
package in this workspace.

To add a new entry, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to choose the packages you touched, the type of version bump,
and a short changelog entry. Each merged changeset will later be collected by
the automated release workflow to produce a version PR and publish the updated
packages to npm.
